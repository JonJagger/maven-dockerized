   (if you already have a sh/ dir delete it first)

3. in your new sh/env-vars.sh file, edit the top
   four environment variables, as per their comments.
       POM_ARTIFACT_ID
       POM_VERSION
       PROJECT_NAME
       APP_PORT

   (if you already have a Dockerfile, replace it)

5. add the cloned repo's /start.sh to your repo's root dir
   (if you already have a start.sh, replace it)

Part 3: Check it works!

git commit your changes
git push your changes

if the TeamCity build step goes through ok your app should be
running on YOUR_IP_ADDRESS/your-home-page.html

Note there is no port number.
