git clone https://github.com/JonJagger/maven-dockerized.git

1. replace /sh in your repo with its sh/

2. in your new sh/env-vars.sh file, edit the top
   four environment variables, as per the comments.
       POM_ARTIFACT_ID
       POM_VERSION
       PROJECT_NAME
       APP_PORT

   (if you already have a Dockerfile, replace it)
